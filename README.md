# rep-table
This is the project I used to build the table that loads at http://allowdebate.com/dnc

Forked from http://codepen.io/zavoloklom/pen/IGkDz and adapted to pull in data from the Google Sheets JSON API and builds the table using Javascript/jQuery.

Having just learned about the asyncronous nature of Javascript while looking into node.js was super helpful for making sure I write the API call correctly, executing the function only once the JSON object is returned. Otherwise I probably would have tried to store the JSON object in a variable and then call it on the next line down.

Also got familiar with LESS and [Webstorm (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) in the process, which is fantastic. Can't recommend it enough. [Here's the video series I watched on LESS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQYJUeokqOY)

All in all, the project probably took around 20-25 hours, and definitely had to learn along the way.
